# Queue

A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element that is inserted into the queue is the first element that is removed.

# Queue Operations

## Enqueue

To enqueue an element into a queue, you need to specify the element to be enqueued. The element will be added to the end of the queue.

## Dequeue

To dequeue an element from a queue, you need to specify the element to be dequeued. The element will be removed from the front of the queue.

## Peek

To peek at the element at the front of the queue, you need to specify the element to be peeked at. The element will be returned, but it will not be removed from the queue.

## Is empty

To check if a queue is empty, you need to specify the queue. The function will return true if the queue is empty, and false otherwise.

## Is full

To check if a queue is full, you need to specify the queue. The function will return true if the queue is full, and false otherwise.
